# Measurement tools

This directory contains developer tools for measuring Anonymizer runs and
exporting measurement JSONL to tables. Run the tools inside the project
environment, either with an activated venv or through `uv run`.

## Measurement schema compatibility

Measurement schema versions are durable data contracts. Homogeneous schema v1
and v2 snapshots and their completion seals remain valid indefinitely, while
mixed-version snapshots are rejected. W&B publication keeps the schema version
as a sanitized top-level comparison value, and first-party reports and
workspaces group by it alongside the suite, sweep-arm, or imported-config
identity. Do not add v1-to-v2 metric aliases: compare versions separately.

Use these tools when you need evidence about cost, latency, reliability, or
anonymization quality. They are not product entry points.

## Quick export to DataFrames or CSV

Start here when you have a `measurements.jsonl` file and want to analyze it in
pandas, Polars, a spreadsheet, or another local tool.

```bash
uv run python tools/measurement/export_measurements.py \
  benchmark-runs/suite/measurements.jsonl \
  --output benchmark-runs/suite/tables \
  --overwrite
```

By default, the exporter writes one Parquet table per measurement record type
plus `manifest.json`:

- `run.parquet`
- `stage.parquet`
- `record.parquet`
- `evaluation_record.parquet` when replace judge evaluation is enabled
- `ndd_workflow.parquet` when DataDesigner adapter records are present
- `model_workflow.parquet` when direct model workflow records are present

Use CSV or JSONL when those are easier to inspect:

```bash
uv run python tools/measurement/export_measurements.py \
  benchmark-runs/suite/measurements.jsonl \
  --output benchmark-runs/suite/tables-csv \
  --format csv \
  --overwrite
```

Then load the tables directly:

```python
import pandas as pd

records = pd.read_parquet("benchmark-runs/suite/tables/record.parquet")
stages = pd.read_parquet("benchmark-runs/suite/tables/stage.parquet")
ndd = pd.read_parquet("benchmark-runs/suite/tables/ndd_workflow.parquet")
```

You can also read the raw log, but the exporter is the better default because
it splits records by `record_type` and normalizes nested fields into columns.

```python
import pandas as pd

raw = pd.read_json("benchmark-runs/suite/measurements.jsonl", lines=True)
```

## System overview

The measurement system has four cooperating layers:

- Instrumentation in Anonymizer emits JSONL records for runs, stages,
  DataDesigner workflows, direct model workflows, per-record safety metrics,
  and optional sanitized replace-judge evaluation metrics.
- Benchmark runners create repeatable workloads and write those JSONL records
  plus optional sidecars such as detection artifacts and DataDesigner traces.
- Analysis tools convert raw run artifacts into case, group, and model tables.
- Shared benchmark helpers record sanitized execution context and finalize W&B
  benchmark logging without moving aggregation into execution backends.

External/distributed execution is a separate boundary. Detection export APIs are
responsible for building DataDesigner configs that an external runtime can
execute. The tools here should consume the resulting measurement JSONL,
detection artifacts, and trace sidecars; they should not own Slurm
orchestration or distributed DataDesigner execution.

## Tool map

| Task | Tool |
| --- | --- |
| Export raw measurement JSONL to tables | `export_measurements.py` |
| Run repeatable Anonymizer suites | `run_benchmarks.py` |
| Inspect detection artifact sidecars | `analyze_detection_artifacts.py` |
| Analyze benchmark output directories | `analyze_benchmark_output.py` |
| Write an atomic external-case completion seal | `write_completion_seal.py` |
| Import one sealed external case into W&B | `import_wandb_run.py` |
| Create W&B benchmark workspaces or reports | `create_wandb_report.py` |
| Run benchmark parameter sweeps | `sweep_benchmarks.py` |

Most workflows start with `run_benchmarks.py`, then either export the raw
measurement log with `export_measurements.py` or summarize the benchmark output
directory with `analyze_benchmark_output.py`. W&B workflows can also create
project workspaces, reports, or one-run-per-arm sweeps from the benchmark
artifacts.

## Implementation shape

The scripts keep workload-specific row models and metric logic local, but share
boring command and export policy through `measurement_tools/`:

- `measurement_tools.cli`: `LogFormat`, logging setup, and structured
  bad-input errors.
- `measurement_tools.execution`: sanitized local/Slurm execution metadata for
  benchmark summaries and W&B config.
- `measurement_tools.tables`: `ExportFormat`, model-row table specs, manifest
  writing, and CSV/Parquet/JSONL output.
- `measurement_tools.stats`: small numeric helpers used by analysis groupers.
- `measurement_tools.wandb_completion`: completion-seal models, atomic writes,
  and snapshot verification.
- `measurement_tools.wandb_ingress`: bounded descriptor-based capture and
  strict measurement record parsing.
- `measurement_tools.wandb_metric_schema`: shared W&B metric names, path
  construction, and scalar aggregation policies.
- `measurement_tools.wandb_models`: resolved settings and outbound payload
  models with field exposure policies.
- `measurement_tools.wandb_report_models`: historical v1 and current v2 report
  views with explicit comparison axes.
- `measurement_tools.wandb_setup`: guarded W&B environment, staging, and SDK
  lifecycle ownership.

This is intentionally composition-based. New analysis tools should declare
their own row models and call the shared helpers rather than inheriting from a
common analyzer base class.

## Benchmark runner

`run_benchmarks.py` runs repeatable Anonymizer workloads and writes the same
measurement JSONL format, one raw file per benchmark case plus a combined
`measurements.jsonl`.

```bash
uv run python tools/measurement/run_benchmarks.py suite.yaml --output benchmark-runs/suite
uv run python tools/measurement/run_benchmarks.py suite.yaml --dry-run --json
uv run python tools/measurement/run_benchmarks.py suite.yaml \
  --output benchmark-runs/suite \
  --dd-trace last_message
uv run python tools/measurement/run_benchmarks.py suite.yaml \
  --output benchmark-runs/suite \
  --dd-task-trace
```

The repo-data smoke suite can be run with DataDesigner traces enabled:

```bash
bash tools/measurement/examples/run-repo-data-smoke-with-dd-traces.sh
```

The script writes to `/tmp/anonymizer-repo-data-smoke-dd-traces` by default.
Pass a different output directory as the first argument, or set
`DD_TRACE_MODE=all_messages` when full chat history is needed:

```bash
DD_TRACE_MODE=all_messages \
  bash tools/measurement/examples/run-repo-data-smoke-with-dd-traces.sh \
  /tmp/anonymizer-repo-data-smoke-dd-traces-full
```

## Benchmark CI

`.github/workflows/benchmark-ci.yml` runs the same benchmark runner from a
manual GitHub Actions dispatch. It targets the self-hosted
`anonymizer-evals` runner, checks out the requested ref, installs the project
environment, runs a suite, appends a short case summary to the GitHub step
summary, and uploads the full output directory as a workflow artifact.

The job is intentionally manual. It runs only through `workflow_dispatch`; it
does not run on `push`, `pull_request`, `schedule`, or the default PR CI path.
GitHub exposes manual dispatch only after the workflow file exists on the
repository default branch. After that, launch it from the Actions UI, GitHub
CLI, or API.

The default suite is `tools/measurement/examples/repo-data-smoke.yaml`. Dispatch
inputs let operators choose the ref, suite path, output directory,
DataDesigner message trace mode, sanitized scheduler task traces, and
fail-fast behavior. The workflow requires the repository secret
`NVIDIA_API_KEY` because the default model configuration uses NVIDIA-hosted
models.

The `ref` input defaults to `main`. To benchmark a PR or experiment branch, set
`ref` to that branch name or commit SHA. The workflow checks out that ref and
uses the benchmark runner and suite files from the checkout, so the selected ref
must contain `tools/measurement/run_benchmarks.py` and the requested suite path.

Benchmark suites are YAML files with three parts:

- `workloads`: input datasets and text-column metadata.
- `configs`: Anonymizer replace or rewrite configurations.
- `matrix`: optional workload/config pairs and repetition counts. When omitted,
  every workload is crossed with every config once.

Example:

```yaml
suite_id: biography-smoke
model_configs: ./model-configs.yaml
model_providers: ./providers.yaml
run_tags:
  anonymizer_ref: main
  commit_sha: abc123
  pipeline_id: "456"
case_retries: 1
case_retry_backoff_sec: 10
workloads:
  - id: biographies
    source: ./data/biographies.csv
    text_column: text
    row_limit: 25
  - id: support
    source: ./data/support.csv
    text_column: body
    id_column: ticket_id
    row_offset: 100
    row_limit: 50
configs:
  - id: redact-default
    replace: redact
    evaluate: true
  - id: hash-agent-labels
    detect:
      entity_labels: [person, email, api_key, password]
    replace:
      strategy: hash
      digest_length: 12
  - id: rewrite-low-risk
    rewrite:
      risk_tolerance: low
      max_repair_iterations: 1
matrix:
  - workload: biographies
    config: redact-default
    repetitions: 3
  - workload: support
    config: hash-agent-labels
```

Use `row_limit` and `row_offset` to create cheap, repeatable slices of a local
CSV or Parquet workload. The runner materializes a per-case sliced input under
`raw/inputs/` before calling Anonymizer, so each case keeps a stable input file
even when the matrix has multiple configs or repetitions. Slicing is rejected
for URL-like sources because the runner cannot safely materialize a local
subset without downloading the whole dataset first.

Relative paths in suite files are resolved from the suite file's directory.
The runner refuses to write into a non-empty output directory unless
`--overwrite` is set. By default it also exports Parquet tables into `tables/`;
pass `--no-export` when only raw measurement JSONL is needed.

Set `model_configs` and `model_providers` explicitly in checked-in or CI suites.
Relying on Anonymizer defaults makes a run depend on the caller's installed
defaults and provider environment. In provider YAML, put environment variable
names such as `NVIDIA_API_KEY` in `api_key`; do not commit raw keys. The bundled
`repo-data-smoke.yaml` follows this pattern with adjacent model/provider files.

Use `run_tags` for stable suite-level metadata copied into every measurement
record, such as source refs, commit SHAs, CI pipeline IDs, topology labels, or
benchmark-suite revisions. The runner reserves `suite_id`, `workload_id`,
`config_id`, `repetition`, and `case_id` for its own case identity tags.

## W&B Benchmark Logging

The benchmark runner can log sanitized measurement summaries to Weights &
Biases. W&B benchmark logging is disabled by default. Only
`tools/measurement/run_benchmarks.py` starts W&B runs; the Anonymizer SDK and
product CLI do not.

Install the optional measurement dependency group before enabling W&B benchmark
logging:

```bash
uv sync --group measurement
```

Enable a benchmark run with CLI flags:

```bash
uv run python tools/measurement/run_benchmarks.py suite.yaml --wandb-mode offline
uv run python tools/measurement/run_benchmarks.py suite.yaml --wandb-mode online --wandb-project my-project
uv run python tools/measurement/run_benchmarks.py suite.yaml --wandb-mode online --wandb-entity my-team --wandb-group nightly --wandb-job-type benchmark --wandb-run-name biography-smoke-main --wandb-tags privacy,nightly
uv run python tools/measurement/run_benchmarks.py suite.yaml --wandb-mode online --wandb-base-url https://wandb.example.com
```

The same settings can come from environment variables when the corresponding
CLI flag is omitted: `ANONYMIZER_MEASUREMENT_WANDB_MODE`,
`ANONYMIZER_MEASUREMENT_WANDB_ENTITY`,
`ANONYMIZER_MEASUREMENT_WANDB_PROJECT`,
`ANONYMIZER_MEASUREMENT_WANDB_BASE_URL`,
`ANONYMIZER_MEASUREMENT_WANDB_GROUP`,
`ANONYMIZER_MEASUREMENT_WANDB_JOB_TYPE`,
`ANONYMIZER_MEASUREMENT_WANDB_RUN_NAME`,
`ANONYMIZER_MEASUREMENT_WANDB_TAGS`, and
`ANONYMIZER_MEASUREMENT_WANDB_LOG_TABLES`. Generic W&B routing variables such
as `WANDB_MODE`, `WANDB_PROJECT`, `WANDB_GROUP`, `WANDB_JOB_TYPE`, `WANDB_NAME`,
and `WANDB_TAGS` are deliberately ignored. Precedence is an explicit CLI value,
then the corresponding `ANONYMIZER_MEASUREMENT_WANDB_*` variable, then the
publisher default. The W&B SDK still receives its audited timeout variables,
including `WANDB_HTTP_TIMEOUT` and `WANDB_INIT_TIMEOUT`. Authentication comes
from the SDK's local credential files under the preserved home directory or
from `WANDB_API_KEY` when the launcher provides it in the process environment.
Set a self-hosted endpoint through `--wandb-base-url` or
`ANONYMIZER_MEASUREMENT_WANDB_BASE_URL`; ambient `WANDB_BASE_URL` is ignored.
Remote endpoints require HTTPS. Plain HTTP is accepted only for loopback
development endpoints. SDK error reporting is disabled before W&B is imported.
W&B limits each tag to 64 characters. Configuration rejects unsafe operator
tags before benchmark execution. The publisher compacts long generated suite or
branch tags to a readable prefix plus a 12-character SHA-256 suffix.

Each W&B benchmark run config includes sanitized benchmark metadata: suite/case
counts, retry and execution flags, package/runtime versions, git
commit/branch/dirty state, model source presence booleans, workload summaries,
matrix entries, and one sanitized object per benchmark config. Workload
metadata stores source kind and suffix instead of the raw source.
Config metadata records settings such as detection thresholds, entity-label
count/hash, replacement strategy knobs, rewrite risk tolerance, repair settings,
and booleans for prompt-bearing fields rather than their raw text.

The benchmark suite finishes and closes its artifacts before the native
publisher starts. The publisher then reads the measurement JSONL as one bounded
regular-file snapshot. Descriptor-relative traversal pins every path component
and refuses symlinks. The publisher verifies the file owner, link count,
identity, size, SHA-256 digest, schema version, record count, run identities,
and case statuses before importing or initializing the W&B SDK. Hard links,
special files, source mutation, oversized lines, excessive JSON nesting, trace
records, unknown fields, coercions, negative counts, and non-finite numbers
fail validation. Model-workflow extension fields remain under an explicit
`local_fields` object in the local artifact; W&B ingress validates that shape
and excludes the object from outbound payloads. Unknown top-level fields still
fail validation. The default limits are 32 MiB, 100,000 records, 1 MiB per
line, and 16 JSON levels.
Publication remains best-effort at the benchmark boundary, so validation or
W&B failures do not change benchmark case status.

By default the runner logs only aggregate benchmark and measurement scalars.
Passing `--wandb-log-tables` uploads sanitized measurement tables as W&B tables;
this remains separate from DataDesigner trace sidecars. Seven strict table-row
models project run, stage, record, evaluation, model-workflow, NDD-workflow, and
trace-coverage records directly from the captured snapshot. The native path
does not parse those records through Pandas. Strict nested models also validate
all run config, summary, and history payloads. The runner disables W&B console,
code, Git, machine metadata, system statistics, and requirements capture. Raw
input text, prompts, model responses, replacement maps, entity payloads, trace
records, paths, URLs, data summaries, model/provider config payloads, and suite
`run_tags` are excluded. Use `--wandb-tags` for tags intentionally sent to W&B.

Suite, workload, and config identifiers, Git branch names, and W&B routing
fields are visible metadata. Keep these values free of customer data and other
sensitive information.

W&B writes local run state under `<benchmark-output>/.wandb-private`. The runner
creates this directory with owner-only permissions before calling the W&B SDK.
The runner rejects symlinks, untrusted writable parent directories, and output
directories owned by another user. Root-owned, group-writable project
directories are trusted shared-storage ancestors, but the final benchmark output
directory and `.wandb-private` staging directory must still be owned by the
current user. Keep the directory when an offline run must be synchronized later.

During SDK use, a process-wide guard replaces the process environment with a
minimal runtime allowlist, audited W&B timeout settings, and the fully resolved
publisher settings. Local W&B credential files remain available through the
preserved home directory, and `WANDB_API_KEY` remains available when explicitly
provided by a launcher. Proxy settings, custom CA settings, and ambient
`WANDB_*` routing values are withheld from the SDK. The
guard restores the exact original environment after the explicit run handle finishes.
Nested or concurrent native publishers in one process are rejected. Each
native run receives a fresh opaque 128-bit ID and uses `resume="never"`.
Successful initialization is paired with exactly one `finish()` call. Strict
publisher callers receive both publication and finish errors when both fail;
the native runner logs only the exception type to avoid echoing source values.

### Import a Sealed Slurm Case

Before an external launcher starts benchmark work, verify W&B authentication from
the same account or container and the same preserved home directory used by the
publisher. Keep credentials in the local W&B credential files or pass
`WANDB_API_KEY` through the launcher environment. Do not pass a key on the
command line.

```bash
# W&B public cloud, using a stored SDK credential
uv run wandb login --verify --cloud

# Self-hosted or dedicated cloud, using a stored SDK credential
uv run wandb login --verify --host https://wandb.example.com
```

Both commands verify the stored credential against the selected endpoint and
exit nonzero on failure. Pass the same endpoint to the benchmark or importer
through `--wandb-base-url`; the publisher ignores ambient `WANDB_BASE_URL`.
Avoid `wandb status` in launcher logs because it prints active settings that can
include credential material. The publisher also withholds proxy and custom-CA
environment variables, so test connectivity without relying on those variables.

External Slurm workflows must write `completion-seal.json` after the
measurement writer closes and the case reaches its completed terminal stage
without an errored workflow or stage record. Every measurement record must
carry the same `case_id`, `workload_id`, `config_id`, and `repetition` tags, and
the run ID must equal the case ID. The seal binds the measurement SHA-256
digest, byte and record counts, expected run ID, case identity, Slurm
provenance, and producer commit. The writer pins each parent directory without
following symlinks and rejects untrusted writable directories. Root-owned,
group-writable project directories are trusted shared-storage ancestors, but the
final case directory that receives `completion-seal.json` must still be owned by
the current user. The companion workflow in `anonymizer-experiments` calls the
seal writer after its case report:

```bash
uv run python tools/measurement/write_completion_seal.py \
  /path/to/case/benchmark/measurements.jsonl \
  --case-id dataset__config__r000 \
  --workload-id dataset-split \
  --config-id config \
  --repetition 0 \
  --phase baseline \
  --case-index 0 \
  --slurm-job detection=12345 \
  --slurm-job replacement=12346 \
  --producer-repository anonymizer-experiments \
  --producer-commit 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567
```

Import the sealed case with the strict importer:

```bash
uv run python tools/measurement/import_wandb_run.py \
  /path/to/case/benchmark/measurements.jsonl \
  --seal-path /path/to/case/benchmark/completion-seal.json \
  --wandb-mode online \
  --wandb-entity my-team \
  --wandb-project nemo-anonymizer-benchmarks \
  --json
```

External launchers can add safe benchmark identity fields to W&B config for
filtering and comparisons:

```bash
  --benchmark-role candidate \
  --benchmark-kind pr \
  --suite-version 2026-07-30 \
  --branch contributor/feat/wandb-benchmark-identity \
  --commit-sha 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567 \
  --pr-number 210 \
  --anonymizer-config-id rat-rewrite-throughput \
  --anonymizer-mode rewrite
```

`--pr-number` is required for `--benchmark-kind pr` and `branch`. Main and
release baselines can omit it.

The importer captures the seal and JSONL once, verifies their content binding,
builds the complete typed payload, then initializes W&B. It derives a stable
128-bit run ID from the destination, sealed case identity, seal digest, schema
namespace, and sanitizer version. Identical imports use `resume="allow"` and
converge on the same run ID. A completed matching publication is a no-op;
recovery of an incomplete publication uses deterministic history step zero,
and conflicting sealed content is rejected. Changed bytes require a new valid
seal and produce a different run ID. Init, config, log, summary, and finish failures exit
nonzero; error logs include the exception type without its message.

Strict online imports require `--wandb-entity` (or
`ANONYMIZER_MEASUREMENT_WANDB_ENTITY`) so the result always identifies the
destination and includes a W&B run URL. Offline imports may omit the entity.

### NVIDIA PR vs. Main Scorecard

The NVIDIA benchmark project has a saved
[PR vs. main scorecard](https://wandb.ai/nemo-llm-service/nemo-anonymizer-benchmarks/reports/PR-vs-main-scorecard--VmlldzoxNzY4NTMzMA).
The report does not query every benchmark run directly. It displays one active
dashboard snapshot generated from eligible imported runs.

A benchmark run enters the scorecard snapshot only when all of these conditions
hold:

- The W&B run state is `finished`.
- `benchmark_role` is `main-baseline` or `candidate`.
- `anonymizer_mode` is `replace` or `rewrite`.
- The run config contains `anonymizer_config_id`, and `benchmark_config_ids`
  resolves to at least one config ID.
- The run summary contains `publication/complete=true`.

The scorecard matches main and candidate runs by `anonymizer_config_id` and
`benchmark_config_ids`. It separates datasets by `benchmark_workload_ids`.
Use the same values for a comparison pair; PR candidates also require a PR
number. The sealed case supplies `benchmark_config_ids` and
`benchmark_workload_ids`. The importer command supplies the remaining identity
fields.

Append fields like these to the strict importer command above for a main
baseline:

```bash
  --benchmark-role main-baseline \
  --benchmark-kind main \
  --branch main \
  --commit-sha 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567 \
  --anonymizer-config-id rat-replace-throughput \
  --anonymizer-mode replace
```

Use matching comparison identifiers for the candidate:

```bash
  --benchmark-role candidate \
  --benchmark-kind pr \
  --branch contributor/feat/local-models \
  --commit-sha 89abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef \
  --pr-number 212 \
  --anonymizer-config-id rat-replace-throughput \
  --anonymizer-mode replace
```

The strict sealed importer is the only repository command that currently emits
the completion marker and accepts the full scorecard identity. Native runs from
`run_benchmarks.py --wandb-mode online` do not set those fields and will not
appear in this scorecard. They remain available in the W&B runs table and in
workspaces created by `create_wandb_report.py`.

After publishing both sides, rerun the scorecard snapshot publisher. That
publisher is not shipped in this repository. The active W&B dashboard run
retains its source as `code/publish_pr_scorecard.py`, but the publisher also
depends on a team-owned HTML template and saved-view state. Until those assets
move into the repository, coordinate the refresh with the dashboard publisher
owner. A successful benchmark import does not refresh the saved scorecard by
itself.

The goal of W&B support is to get sanitized benchmark data into W&B. Workspaces,
reports, views, and panels are presentation layers on top of that data. They
can be edited in W&B, regenerated with the tooling below, or replaced as the
benchmark questions change.

Create a W&B benchmark workspace or report for uploaded benchmark runs with
the report utility:

```bash
uv run python tools/measurement/create_wandb_report.py \
  entity/project/run-id

uv run python tools/measurement/create_wandb_report.py \
  entity/project \
  --workspace
```

The benchmark report utility can create a manual W&B workspace with focused
sections for benchmark summary, privacy, utility, cost/throughput, sweep
comparison, and sanitized tables. The sweep comparison section includes a Run
Comparer panel plus parameter-tradeoff panels. The same utility can still build
a draft report from sanitized benchmark run summary/config fields and a panel
grid filtered to one run. Pass `--publish` when a report should be saved as a
published report instead of a draft. Workspace/report generation requires the
measurement dependency group because it uses the `wandb[workspaces]` extra.
The reader projects remote data into closed v1 and v2 run views. It groups
native runs by suite identity, sweep runs by arm identity, and imported runs by
config identity. Mixed run kinds fail before report creation. The Markdown
renderer escapes link labels, code spans, table cells, headings, and list text,
and reconstructs run URLs from validated entity, project, and run identifiers.

Generated workspaces and reports are not canonical artifacts. The W&B project
data is canonical. If a workspace layout, report panel, or project view stops
answering the benchmark question, update it directly in W&B or rerun the
workspace/report command.

Reports include panels for case health and latency, DataDesigner row flow,
request health, token usage, throughput, record privacy counters, replacement
quality counters, stage throughput, and sanitized measurement tables when table
logging is enabled.

For parameter sweeps, use one W&B benchmark run per sweep arm:

```yaml
sweep_id: qwen-threshold-smoke
base_suite: ./repo-data-smoke-qwen3-coder-next.yaml
parameters:
  configs.*.detect.gliner_threshold: [0.2, 0.4]
  configs.legal-hash-agent-labels.replace.digest_length: [8, 12]
```

```bash
uv run python tools/measurement/sweep_benchmarks.py sweep.yaml \
  --wandb-mode online \
  --wandb-entity my-team \
  --wandb-project nemo-anonymizer-benchmarks \
  --create-workspace
```

Each arm materializes a generated suite under the sweep output root and runs
`run_benchmarks.py` once. Sweep metadata is copied into safe run tags and W&B
benchmark run config fields such as `sweep_id`, `sweep_arm_id`, and
`sweep_param_*` so W&B benchmark workspaces and reports can compare arms
directly. A benchmark group workspace or report can also be created later:

```bash
uv run python tools/measurement/create_wandb_report.py \
  my-team/nemo-anonymizer-benchmarks \
  --group qwen-threshold-smoke

uv run python tools/measurement/create_wandb_report.py \
  my-team/nemo-anonymizer-benchmarks \
  --workspace \
  --group qwen-threshold-smoke
```

Set `evaluate: true` on a replace config when the benchmark should run
`Anonymizer.evaluate()` after `run()` and capture the LLM-as-judge work in the
same case. This is intentionally replace-only for now; rewrite runs already
perform their internal evaluation/repair loop during `run()`.

When evaluation is enabled, the safe measurement log includes
`evaluation_record` rows with judge verdict booleans and invalid-item counts.
It does not persist the evaluated result dataframe or trace dataframe. Those
dataframes can contain original text, entity values, replacement values, raw
judge outputs, prompts, and model responses.

Before starting a real run, the benchmark runner performs cheap preflight
checks: suite/config parsing, local dataset existence, CSV/Parquet text-column
metadata, provider YAML shape, and active model-alias references. `--dry-run`
runs those same checks, expands the planned matrix, and skips output-dir writes
and model work.

Use `case_retries` and `case_retry_backoff_sec` for long-running suites on
shared model endpoints. Retries are disabled by default. When enabled, a failed
case is retried with the same `case_id` and output paths; the final case still
records `attempt_count` and `attempt_errors` in `summary.json`. `--fail-fast`
remains fail-fast and bypasses retries.

## DataDesigner traces

For debugging DataDesigner calls, pass `--dd-trace last_message` or
`--dd-trace all_messages`. Trace records are written separately from sanitized
measurements, under `traces/{case_id}.jsonl` by default. Use `--trace-dir` to
choose another directory. `last_message` stores only the final prompt message
for each DataDesigner model call; `all_messages` stores the full message list.

DataDesigner traces may contain raw input text, prompts, model outputs, entity
values, replacement values, secrets, and PII. Treat them as debug artifacts:
keep them out of shared benchmark bundles unless they have been reviewed or
redacted.

Anonymizer requests standard LLM-column traces through DataDesigner native LLM
column trace side effects. That covers `LLMTextColumnConfig` and
`LLMStructuredColumnConfig`. Model-backed `CustomColumnConfig` generator
functions are traced through a temporary Anonymizer shim that instruments the
per-run DataDesigner model registry and returned model facades. This is a
brittle bridge over private DataDesigner internals until DataDesigner exposes a
public model-call trace sink.

Safe measurement output includes a `dd_trace_coverage` record with native,
private-facade, and unsupported column counts so trace-enabled runs can detect
which path covered each workflow.

## DataDesigner Scheduler Task Traces

Pass `--dd-task-trace` to collect sanitized DataDesigner async scheduler task
timing records. The benchmark runner writes one sidecar per case under
`task-traces/{case_id}.jsonl` by default; use `--task-trace-dir` to choose
another directory.

Task trace records are separate from raw message traces. They include scheduler
metadata such as workflow name, column, row group, row index, task type, status,
relative dispatch/slot-acquired/completion offsets, queue wait time, execution
time, total time, and whether an error was present. They intentionally do not
store raw DataDesigner error strings because those can contain prompts, outputs,
or source values.

Offsets are relative to the earliest positive `dispatched_at` timestamp in each
DataDesigner workflow trace batch written into the case sidecar. They are meant
for timeline analysis without storing host-specific wall-clock timestamps.

```bash
uv run python tools/measurement/run_benchmarks.py \
  suite.yaml \
  --output benchmark-runs/suite \
  --dd-task-trace
```

## Benchmark analysis

`analyze_benchmark_output.py` joins `measurements.jsonl`, optional
DataDesigner traces, and detection artifact sidecars into richer case/group
tables:

```bash
uv run python tools/measurement/analyze_benchmark_output.py \
  benchmark-runs/suite-id \
  --output benchmark-runs/suite-id/analysis \
  --format csv
```

Important outputs:

- `case_analysis.*`: one row per benchmark case.
- `group_analysis.*`: median and aggregate metrics grouped by workload/config.
- `model_usage.*`: one row per measured model usage entry.
- `model_usage_group_analysis.*`: model usage rolled up by workflow/model.

Use `--detection-artifacts` to provide an explicit detection artifact JSONL
sidecar. Otherwise, the analyzer reads `detection-artifacts.jsonl` in the
benchmark directory when present.

## Pandas patterns

Analysis tables are regular CSV/Parquet files. A typical local workflow:

```python
import pandas as pd

cases = pd.read_parquet("benchmark-runs/suite/analysis/case_analysis.parquet")
groups = pd.read_parquet("benchmark-runs/suite/analysis/group_analysis.parquet")

cols = [
    "workload_id",
    "config_id",
    "median_pipeline_elapsed_sec",
    "median_observed_total_requests",
    "median_observed_total_tokens",
    "measurement_schema_version",
    "median_artifact_detected_entity_signature_count",
]
print(groups[cols].sort_values(["workload_id", "median_pipeline_elapsed_sec"]))

failures = cases[
    (cases["case_failed"]) |
    (cases["observed_failed_requests"] > 0) |
    (cases["dd_trace_error_count"] > 0)
]
print(failures[["case_id", "config_id", "observed_failed_requests", "dd_trace_error_count"]])
```

## Metric interpretation

Use metrics as signals, not as a single score.

Latency and throughput:

- `elapsed_sec`: wall time for a measured stage or workflow.
- `pipeline_elapsed_sec`: end-to-end Anonymizer wall time for a case.
- `records_per_pipeline_sec`: completed input records per pipeline second.
- `input_text_tokens_per_pipeline_sec`: input text tokens processed per
  pipeline second.

Model work:

- `observed_total_requests`: measured model requests from DataDesigner or direct
  model workflow records.
- `observed_total_tokens`: measured input plus output tokens.
- `observed_failed_requests`: provider-level failed requests.
- `observed_bridge_fallback_requests`: sync-client fallback requests recorded
  from DataDesigner traces.
- `observed_non_bridge_failed_requests`: failed requests after subtracting
  sync-client bridge fallbacks. Prefer this field when judging endpoint
  reliability from trace-enabled runs.

Detection artifacts:

- `seed_entity_count`: detector or direct-seed candidate count before
  validation.
- `seed_validation_candidate_count`: candidates sent to validation.
- `estimated_seed_validation_chunk_count`: estimated validator chunks from the
  active validation chunk size.
- `augmented_entity_count`: augmenter suggestions.
- `augmented_new_detected_value_count`: augmenter suggestions that add values
  not already present in the seed set and survive post-validation detection.
- `augmented_new_final_value_count`: those suggestions that also survive into
  `COL_FINAL_ENTITIES`; it is unavailable in sidecars that lack final entities.
- `artifact_detected_*`: post-validation detection counts, source counts, and
  opaque span signatures. Legacy sidecars emitted detected values under
  `final_*`; analysis reads those legacy fields only as detected metrics.
- `artifact_final_*`: materialized final-entity counts and signatures. These
  are populated only by artifact schema v2 rows that include actual final
  entities. Signature fields never include raw entity values.

Safety and replacement:

- `original_value_leak_unique_value_count`: distinct original values with a
  boundary-aware literal match in replaced or rewritten output.
  Matching is exact-case and uses Unicode alphanumeric boundaries; underscore
  is treated as a boundary rather than as part of an identifier token.
- `original_value_leak_source_entity_occurrence_count`: final source entity
  occurrences associated with those matched values. This is not a count of
  independently observed output occurrences. Its label-count companion has
  the same source-occurrence cardinality.
- `original_value_leak_count`: legacy schema-v1 source-occurrence field. Keep
  it separate from schema-v2 series; benchmark groups include measurement
  schema version in their key.
- `replacement_map_entry_count`: entries in the generated replacement map.
- `replacement_targeted_span_count`, `replacement_applied_span_count`, and
  `replacement_skipped_span_count`: direct offset-application outcomes. The
  skipped label counts contain labels only, never original or synthetic text.
- `replacement_missing_final_entity_count`: final entity occurrences whose
  original value has no replacement-map entry.
- `replacement_missing_final_value_count`: unique final entity values with no
  replacement-map entry.
- `replacement_synthetic_original_collision_count`: final entity occurrences
  whose original value was reused as a synthetic replacement value elsewhere in
  the same record.

Replace judge evaluation:

- `detection_valid`, `type_fidelity_valid`,
  `relational_consistency_valid`, and `attribute_fidelity_valid`: per-record
  judge verdicts when `evaluate: true` is enabled.
- `detection_invalid_entity_count`,
  `type_fidelity_invalid_replacement_count`,
  `relational_consistency_invalid_relation_count`, and
  `attribute_fidelity_invalid_entity_count`: counts of invalid judge findings.
  These fields count structures returned by the judges but do not include raw
  values, replacement strings, or judge reasoning text.
- `case_analysis` also includes per-case rollups for each judge family:
  `{family}_judged_record_count`, `{family}_valid_record_count`,
  `{family}_valid_rate`, and the corresponding invalid-count field.
- `group_analysis` includes grouped micro-rate rollups:
  `sum_{family}_judged_record_count`, `sum_{family}_valid_record_count`,
  `micro_{family}_valid_rate`, and `sum_{invalid_count_field}`. These rates are
  computed from summed counts, not medians of case-level rates.
